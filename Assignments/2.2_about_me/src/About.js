      Hi, my name is Nilanjana. I am passionate about computers and I have a
      keen interest and experience in game development, full stack web
      development and competitive coding. I also have a wide array of hobbies
      like reading, writing, travelling, crocheting and playing the flute. I
      have created projects on database migration, AI automated comic generation
      and educational games.
